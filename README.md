# Team GIPHT Portfolio Website
Team GIPHT is comprised of Giulia, Isaac, Phat and Tammy

## WHY
We worked together to build a one page website from scratch that provides a short portfolio of our team as part of the week 1 project for Founders and Coder 13.

## WHAT
The team GIPHT website contains About, Team and Contact sections with a fixed navigation bar.

#### About
The About section is what you see when you load the site and contains a headline to give a quick description of what we do.
This fulfills the following user story:
> I want to **visit your site and immediately see a headline about your team**
> So that I **get a concise description of what you have to offer me**.

#### Navigation Bar
Wherever you are in the site there is a navigation bar always in view with link to all three sections.
This fulfills the following user stories:
> I want to **visit your site and see a navigation link for 'About, Team, and Contact'**
> so I can **quickly navigate to the areas of the site I'd like to visit.**

> I want to **click on a navigation link and a corresponding section be made visible in the browser window on the same page**
> So that I **can quickly navigate around the site without having to wait for new pages to be loaded.**

#### Team
The Team page contains a profile of each member of the team with a picture and links to their LinkedIn, GitHub and Codewars profiles.

#### Contact
The Contact page has a contact form so potential clients can send us sufficient information about themselves and what they would like us to do for them.
This fulfills the following user story:
> I want to **be able to contact the developers by filling out and submitting a form by providing my name, email and message information**
> So that **the team have sufficient information to contact me afterwards**

### Accesibility
We designed the site using a mobile-first aproach with media queries to account for larger screen sizes.
This fulfills the following user story:
> I want to **easily view the site when browsing on my mobile, tablet or desktop**
> so that I **can understand the sites content easily on whatever device I choose to view it in.**

We ensured all text is easily readable on all backgrounds, made input fields and buttons larger than the default.
This fulfills the following user story:
> I would like to **easily read and understand the text on your site**
> so I can **understand the information available**

Our page utilizes the tabindex attribute to ensure all sections of the site are accessible by screen readers users. We also used aria-role landmarks such as role=navigation and role=form so that screen readers inform users what the section contains. 
> I would like to **easily understand how to navigate the site after my screen reader reads me the content of the site**
> so I can **understand the information available**.

Our website is fully viewable with Javascript disabled
> I would like **to visit your site and get a similar experience to viewing your site on a modern browser with JavaScript enabled**
> so that I **don't feel like I'm completely in the stone age**.
