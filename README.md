# Team GIPHT Portfolio Website
Team GIPHT is comprised of Giulia, Isaac, Phat and Tammy

## WHY
We worked together to build a one page website from scratch that provides a short portfolio of our team as part of the week 1 project for Founders and Coder 13.

## WHAT
The team GIPHT website contains About, Team and Contact sections with a fixed navigation bar.

The About section is what you see when you load the site and contains a headline to give a quick description of what we do.
This fulfills the following user stories provided by our client:
> I want to **visit your site and immediately see a headline about your team**

> So that I **get a concise description of what you have to offer me**.

Wherever you are in the site there is a navigation bar always in view with link to all three sections.
This fulfills the following user stories provided by our client:
> I want to **visit your site and see a navigation link for 'About, Team, and Contact'**

> so I can **quickly navigate to the areas of the site I'd like to visit.**

> I want to **click on a navigation link and a corresponding section be made visible in the browser window on the same page**

> So that I **can quickly navigate around the site without having to wait for new pages to be loaded.**
